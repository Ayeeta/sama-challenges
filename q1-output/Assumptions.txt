Assumptions:
- A cuboid is a 6-faced rectangular 3d shaped image with 8 vertices and 12 edges
- Cube has to be perfectly shaped
- changing position of coordinates will not affect the result as long as they're 8 vertices
- x,y,z axes are known, I did not have to label them
- plotting lines have to perfectly make up a cube and not any other diagonal figure
- Coordinates are fixed and will not change
- scaled length, width and height is fixed and will not change
